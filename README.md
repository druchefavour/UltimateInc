# UltimateInc Data Analysis
### Part 1 ‑ Exploratory data analysis
Used the attached logins.json file which contains (simulated) timestamps of user logins in a particular geographic location to:
* Aggregate the login counts based on 15­minute time intervals, and
* Visualize and describe the resulting time series of login counts in ways that best characterize the underlying patterns of the demand. 

Reported/illustrated important features of the demand, such as daily cycles and highlighted data quality issues

### Part 2 ‑ Experiment and metrics design
Used factorial design to design and analyse the foregoing experiment. Data are on two neighboring cities of Gotham and Metropolis that have complementary circadian rhythms: 
* on weekdays, Ultimate Gotham is most active at night, and Ultimate Metropolis is most active during the day. 
* On weekends, there is reasonable activity in both cities.
* However, a toll bridge, with a two­way toll, between the two cities causes driver partners to tend to be exclusive to each city. The Ultimate managers of city operations for the two cities have proposed an experiment to encourage driver partners to be available in both cities, by reimbursing all toll costs.

* The key measure of this experiment has been carefully selected which will encourage driver partners to serve both cities. The reason for the choice has also been highlighted
* A practical experiment has been designed to compare the effectiveness of the proposed change in relation to the key measure of success. This includes 
* implementation of the experiment
* statistical test(s) conducted to verify the significance of the observation and
* The interpretation of the results and recommendations to the city operations team.

### Part 3 ‑ Predictive modeling
Built a predictive model for predicting rider retention from a sample dataset of a cohort of users who signed up for an Ultimate account in
January 2014. The target data is the obtained data: 'user retained' which are the users that were “active” (i.e. took a trip) in the preceding 30 days.

The challenge includes:
* 1. Data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and/or visualizations
* 2. Predictive modeling that helps Ultimate determine whether or not a user will be active in their 6th month on the system.
* 3. A discussion of how Ultimate might leverage the insights gained from the model to improve its long­term rider retention
